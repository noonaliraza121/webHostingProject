First of all i headed to free css templetes download website.
Downloaded the zip files.
Then unzipped it.
Then created a directory named webServerProject and pasted all the files and directories into it.
Then initiated git into this directory.
Added all the files and directories into staging area then commited to local repo.
Then created a public repo on github named webHostingProject and pushed all the changes from local to github repo.
Created Dockerfile and tested it then pushed it into github.
Then build the Dockerfile and created image out of it.
Then i gave a tag to my local image and then pushed that image to my dockerhub repo.
Here's the link to my dockerhub repo you can visit it https://hub.docker.com/repositories/alirazanoon
